# Recipe search 🌮🍟🥞

Fun recipe search tool, using the Forkify (https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) API. Implementation of the concepts learned during the Modern React with Redux course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/). Check it out: https://recipe-search-f2768.web.app/

## Why?

I've never built something using an API before 😄 So it was both a refresher and solidifying new concepts.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the used dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
